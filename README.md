# Blackjack Application
This is a program for how to play blackjack. Although incomplete it has a multitude of classes that call on other classes, and enums to perform the game. In order to play a dealer must get the deck, shuffle it and pass out cards to one or more player to include the dealer. The Player has to get cards from a dealer, get the cards total value, and decide if he wants to hit or stay. The objective of the game is to have a higher hand total than the dealer without going over 21. If either player or the dealer goes over 21 it is a bust. If either player or the dealer gets 21 exactly it is called blackjack and that player automatically wins. If the player or the dealer tie its a push and their is no winner.

# Lesson Learned
I learned how to create enumerated types and have classes call on those enums. The blackjack project also brought out an emphasis on UML designs, this is a crucial part of programming figuring out what class will do what in java and in real life. I haven't gotten down combining everything we have learned so far definitely have to constantly study and refresh my mind on what all these definitions and functions of java are. Its a wide list of options to do different or even the same thing that I can be confused when deciding what to pick or remembering how to implement the functions but this was definitely fun. I will continue to study and learn how to better map these things out.
