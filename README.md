# Blackjack Application
This is a program for how to play blackjack. Although incomplete it has a multitude of classes that call on other classes, and enums to perform the game. In order to play a dealer must get the deck, shuffle it and pass out cards to the player and the dealer. The Player has to get cards from a dealer, get the cards total value, and decide if he wants to hit or stay. The objective of the game is to have a higher hand total than the dealer without going over 21. If either player or the dealer goes over 21 it is a bust. If either player or the dealer gets 21 exactly it is called blackjack and that player automatically wins. If the player or the dealer tie its a push and their is no winner. The winner will display and the game will end after each round. When the game ends it will print out the remaining cards and the amount of cards left in the deck to the terminal.

# Lesson Learned
I learned how to create enumerated types and have classes call on those enums. The blackjack project also brought out an emphasis on UML designs, this is a crucial part of programming figuring out what class will do what in java and in real life. I learned I can combine all the if statements to determine a winning condition for blackjack. I also learned to manage and use each condition to create other conditions for doing something else by using the conditions in the method to get another method.
